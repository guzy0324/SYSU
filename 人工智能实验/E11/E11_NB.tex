\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}

The UCI dataset (\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php}) is the most widely used dataset for machine learning. If you are interested in other datasets in other areas, you can refer to \url{https://www.zhihu.com/question/63383992/answer/222718972}.

Today's experiment is conducted with the \textbf{Adult Data Set} which can be found in \url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult}.

\section{Naive Bayes}

Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. It is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that \textbf{the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature}, given the class variable.

For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the ``naive'' assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable. Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship, given class variable $y$ and dependent feature vector $x_1$ through $x_n$:
$$P(y\ |\ x_1,...,x_n)=\frac{P(y)P(x_1,...,x_n\ |\ y)}{P(x_1,...,x_n)}$$
Using the naive conditional independence assumption that 
$$P(x_i\ |\ y,x_1,...,x_{i-1},x_{x+1},...,x_n)=P(x_i\ |\ y)$$,
for all $i$, this relationship is simplified to 
$$P(y\ | x_1,...,x_n)=\frac{P(y)\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i\ |\ y)}{P(x_1,...,x_n)}$$
Since $P(x_1,...,x_n)$ is constant given the input, we can use the following classification rule:
$$P(y\ | x_1,...,x_n)\propto P(y)\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i\ |\ y)$$
$$\hat{y}=\arg\max\limits_y P(y)\prod^n_{i=1}P(x_i\ |\ y),$$
and we can use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate $P(y)$ and $P(x_i\ |\ y)$, the former is then the relative frequency of class $y$ in the training set.

The different naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of $P(x_i\ |\ y)$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item When attribute values are discrete, $P(x_i\ |\ y)$ can be easily computed according to the training set.
	\item When attribute values are continuous, an assumption is made that the values associated with each class are distributed according to Gaussian i.e., Normal Distribution. For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute $x$. We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of $x$ in each class. Let $\mu_k$ be the mean of the values in $x$ associated with class $y_k$, and let $\sigma_k^2$ be the variance of the values in $x$ associated with class $y_k$. Suppose we have collected some observation value $x_i$. Then, the probability distribution of $x_i$ given a class $y_k$, $P(x_i\ | y_k)$ can be computed by plugging $x_i$ into the equation for a Normal distribution parameterized by $\mu_k$ and $\sigma_k^2$. That is,
	$$P(x=x_i\ |\ y=y_k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_k^2}}e^{-\frac{(x_i-\mu_k)^2}{2\sigma_k^2}}$$
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Codes and Results}
\subsection{Codes}
\subsubsection{连续值处理}
对每一种属性标签计算$\mu$，$\sigma$。
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
mu = dict()
sigma = dict()
for attribute in attributes:
	name = attribute.name
	if attribute.domain == 'continuous':
		mu[name] = dict()
		sigma[name] = dict()
		for label in counting_table:
			counting = counting_table[label][name]
			n = len(counting)
			if label not in counting_table_total:
				counting_table_total[label] = n
			mu[name][label] = sum(counting) / n
			sigma[name][label] = (sum([(t - mu[name][label]) ** 2\
			for t in counting]) / (n - 1)) ** 0.5
\end{lstlisting}
最后使用正态分布表示概率。
\begin{lstlisting}
if attribute.domain == 'continuous':
	x = float(value)
	P *= math.exp(-(x - mu[name][label]) ** 2 / (2 * sigma[name][label] ** 2))\
		/ ((2 * math.pi) ** 0.5 * sigma[name][label])
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{缺失值处理}
对于训练集，离散属性用众数，连续属性用均值。
\begin{lstlisting}
mode = dict()
for attribute in attributes:
	name = attribute.name
	if attribute.domain == 'continuous':
		counting = counting_table_for_mode[name]
		mode[name] = sum(counting) / len(counting)
	else:
		mode[name] = max(counting_table_for_mode[name],\
		key = lambda k: counting_table_for_mode[name][k])
for label, name in missing_examples:
	if attribute.domain == 'continuous':
		counting_table[label][name].append(mode[name])
	else:
		counting_table[label][name][mode[name]] += 1
\end{lstlisting}
对于测试集，离散属性用训练集的众数，连续属性用训练集的均值。
\begin{lstlisting}
if value == '?':
	value = mode[name]
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{MAP}
$$\begin{aligned}
h_{MAP}&=\mathop{\arg\max}_{h}\textbf{Pr}(h|d)\\
		&=\mathop{\arg\max}_{h}\textbf{Pr}(h)\textbf{Pr}(d|h)\\
		&=\mathop{\arg\max}_{h}\textbf{Count}(h)\prod_i\textbf{Pr}(d_i|h)\\
\end{aligned}$$
对于离散属性：
$$\textbf{Pr}(d_i|h)=\frac{\textbf{Count}(d_i|h)}{\textbf{Count}(h)}$$
对于连续属性：
$$\textbf{Pr}(d_i|h)=\frac{e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}$$
代码如下：
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
P = counting_table_total[label]
for attribute in attributes:
	name = attribute.name
	value = example_attributes[name]
	if value == '?':
		value = mode[name]
	if attribute.domain == 'continuous':
		x = float(value)
		P *= math.exp(-(x - mu[name][label]) ** 2 / (2 * sigma[name][label] ** 2))\
			/ ((2 * math.pi) ** 0.5 * sigma[name][label])
	else:
		P *= counting_table[label][name][value] / counting_table_total[label]
\end{lstlisting}

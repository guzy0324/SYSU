\subsection{The Gaussian Distribution}
The Gaussian, also known as the normal distribution, is a widely used model for the distribution of continuous variables. In the case of a single variable $x$, the Gaussian distribution can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
\mathcal N(x|\mu,\sigma^2)=\frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/2}}\exp\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2\}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance. 

For a $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf x$, the multivariate Gaussian distribution takes the form
\begin{equation}
\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}}\frac{1}{|\boldsymbol\Sigma|^{1/2}}\exp\{-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf x-\boldsymbol\mu)^{\mathrm T}\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf x-\boldsymbol\mu\}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol\mu$ is a $D$-dimensional mean vector, $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ is a $D\times D$ covariance matrix, and $|\boldsymbol\Sigma|$ denotes the determinant of $|\boldsymbol\Sigma|$.
\subsection{Mixtures of Gaussians}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
While the Gaussian distribution has some important analytical properties, it suffers from significant limitations when it comes to modelling real data sets. Consider the example shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}. This is known as the ‘Old Faithful’ data set, and comprises 272 measurements of the eruption of the Old Faithful geyser at Yel-lowstone National Park in the USA. Each measurement comprises the duration of the eruption in minutes (horizontal axis) and the time in minutes to the next eruption (vertical axis). We see that the data set forms two dominant clumps, and that a simple Gaussian distribution is unable to capture this structure, whereas a linear superposition of two Gaussians gives a better characterization of the data set.
\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Example of a Gaussian mixture distribution}
\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

Such superpositions, formed by taking linear combinations of more basic distributions such as Gaussians, can be formulated as probabilistic models known as \emph{mixture distributions}. In Figure \ref{fig:fig1} we see that a linear combination of Gaussians can give rise to very complex densities. By using a sufficient number of Gaussians, and by adjusting their means and covariances as well as the coefficients in the linear combination, almost any continuous density can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy.

We therefore consider a superposition of $K$ Gaussian densities of the form
\begin{equation}\label{equ:mixture}
p(\mathbf x)=\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)
\end{equation}
which is called a mixture of Gaussians. Each Gaussian density  $\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)$ is called a component of the mixture and has its own mean $\boldsymbol\mu_k$ and covariance $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$.

The parameters $\pi_k$ in (\ref{equ:mixture}) are called \emph{mixing coefficients}. If we integrate both sides of (\ref{equ:mixture}) with respect to $\mathbf x$, and note that both $p(\mathbf x)$ and the individual Gaussian
components are normalized, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{equ:sum}
\sum_{k=1}^{K}\pi_k=1.
\end{equation}
Also, the requirement that $p(\mathbf x)\geq 0$, together with $\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\mu_k,\Sigma_k)\geq 0$, implies $\pi_k\geq 0$ for all $k$. Combining this with condition (\ref{equ:sum}) we obtain
\begin{equation}
0\leq\pi_k\leq 1.
\end{equation}

We therefore see that the mixing coefficients satisfy the requirements to be probabilities.

From the sum and product rules, the marginal density is given by

\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf x)=\sum_{k=1}^K p(k)p(\mathbf x|k)
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to (\ref{equ:mixture}) in which we can view $\pi_k=p(k)$ as the prior probability of picking the $k^{th}$ component, and the density $\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)= p(\mathbf x|k)$ as the probability of $\mathbf x$ conditioned on $k$. From Bayes' theorem these are given by
\begin{equation}
\gamma_k(\mathbf x)=p(k|\mathbf x)=\frac{p(k)p(\mathbf x|k)}{\sum_lp(l)p(\mathbf x|l)}=\frac{\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{\boldsymbol\sum_l\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_l,\boldsymbol\Sigma_l)}.
\end{equation}
The form of the Gaussian mixture distribution is governed by the parameters $\pi$, $\boldsymbol\mu$ and $\boldsymbol\Sigma$, where we have used the notation $\boldsymbol\pi=\{\pi_1,...,\pi_K\}$, $\boldsymbol\mu=\{\boldsymbol\mu_1,...,\boldsymbol\mu_k\}$ and $\boldsymbol\Sigma=\{\boldsymbol\Sigma_1,...,\boldsymbol\Sigma_K\}$. One way to set the values of there parameters is to use maximum likelihood. From (\ref{equ:mixture}) the log of the likelihood function is given by 
\begin{equation}
\ln p(\mathbf X|\boldsymbol\pi,\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)=\sum_{n=1}^N\ln\{\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k\}
\end{equation}
where $X = \{\mathbf x_1,...,\mathbf x_N\}$. One approach to maximizing the likelihood function is to use iterative numerical optimization techniques. Alternatively we can employ a powerful framework called expectation maximization (EM).

\subsubsection{About Latent Variables}
We now turn to a formulation of Gaussian mixtures in terms of discrete \emph{latent} variables. This will provide us with a deeper insight into this important distribution, and will also serve to motivate the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

Recall from (\ref{equ:mixture}) that the Gaussian mixture distribution can be written as a linear superposition of Gaussians in the form 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:form3}
p(\mathbf x)=\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)
\end{equation}
Let us introduce a $K$-dimensional binary random variable $\mathbf z$ having a 1-of-$K$ representation in which a particular element $z_k$ is equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0. The values of $z_k$ therefore satisfy $z_k\in\{0,1\}$ and $\Sigma_k z_k=1$, and we see that there are $K$ possible states for the vector $\mathbf z$ according to which element is nonzero. We shall define the joint distribution $p(\mathbf x, \mathbf z)$ in terms of a marginal distribution $p(\mathbf z)$ and a conditional distribution $p(\mathbf x|\mathbf z)$. The marginal distribution over $\mathbf z$ is specified in terms of the mixing coefficients $\pi_k$, such that
\begin{equation}
p(z_k=1)=\pi_k
\end{equation}
where the parameters $\{\pi_k\}$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}
0\leq\pi_k\leq 1
\end{equation}
together with 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k=1
\end{equation}
in order to be valid probabilities. Because $\mathbf z$ uses a 1-of-$K$ representation, we can also write this distribution in the form
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf z)=\prod_{k=1}^K\pi_k^{z_k}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, the conditional distribution of $\mathbf x$ given a particular value for $\mathbf z$ is a Gaussian
\begin{equation}\label{equ:form1}
p(\mathbf x|z_k=1)=\mathcal(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)
\end{equation}
which can also be written in the form
\begin{equation}\label{equ:form2}
p(\mathbf x|\mathbf z)=\prod^K_{k=1}p\mathcal(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)^{z_k}.
\end{equation}
The joint distribution is given by $p(\mathbf z)p(\mathbf x|\mathbf z)$, and the marginal distribution of $\mathbf x$ is then obtained by summing the joint distribution over all possible states of $\mathbf z$ to give
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf x)=\sum_{\mathbf z}p(\mathbf z)p(\mathbf x|\mathbf z)=\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)
\end{equation}
where we have made use of (\ref{equ:form1}) and (\ref{equ:form2}). Thus the marginal distribution of $\mathbf x$ is a Gaussian mixture of the form (\ref{equ:form3}). If we have several observations $\mathbf{x_1,...,x_N}$, then, because we have represented the marginal distribution in the form $p(\mathbf x)=\sum_{\mathbf z}p(\mathbf x,\mathbf z)$, it follows that for every observed data point $\mathbf x_n$ there is a corresponding latent variable $\mathbf z_n$.

We have therefore found an equivalent formulation of the Gaussian mixture involving an explicit latent variable. It might seem that we have not gained much by doing so. However, we are now able to work with the joint distribution $p(\mathbf x, \mathbf z)$ instead of the marginal distribution $p(\mathbf x)$, and this will lead to significant simplifications, most notably through the introduction of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

Another quantity that will play an important role is the conditional probability of $\mathbf z$ given $\mathbf x$. We shall use $\gamma(z_k)$to denote $p(z_k=1|\mathbf x)$, whose value can be found using Bayes’ theorem

\begin{equation}
\gamma(z_k)=p(z_k=1|\mathbf x)=\frac{p(z_k=1)p(\mathbf x|z_k=1)}{\sum_{j=1}^Kp(z_j=1)p(\mathbf x|z_j=1)}=\frac{\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^K\pi_j\mathcal N(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\mu_j,\boldsymbol\Sigma_j)}
\end{equation}
We shall view $\pi_k$ as the prior probability of $z_k=1$, and the quantity $\gamma(z_k)$ as the corresponding posterior probability once we have observed $\mathbf x$. As we shall see later, $\gamma(z_k)$ can also be viewed as the responsibility that component $k$ takes for ‘explaining’ the observation $\mathbf x$.




\subsection{EM for Gaussian Mixtures}
Initially, we shall motivate the EM algorithm by giving a relatively informal treatment in the context of the Gaussian mixture model.

Let us begin by writing down the conditions that must be satisfied at a maximum of the likelihood function. Setting the derivatives of $\ln p(\mathbf X|\boldsymbol\pi,\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)$ with respect to the means $\boldsymbol\mu_k$ of the Gaussian components to zero, we obtain
\begin{equation}
0=-\sum_{n=1}^n\frac{\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{\underbrace{\sum_j\pi_j\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_j,\boldsymbol\Sigma_j)}_{\gamma(z_{nk})}}\sum_k(\mathbf x_n-\boldsymbol\mu_k)
\end{equation}

Multiplying by $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k^{-1}$ (which we assume to be nonsingular) and rearranging we obtain
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\mu_k=\frac{1}{N_k}\sum_{n=1}^N\gamma(z_{nk})\mathbf x_n
\end{equation}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
 N_k=\sum_{n=1}^N\gamma(z_{nk}).
  \end{equation} 

We can interpret $N_k$ as the effective number of points assigned to cluster $k$. Note carefully the form of this solution. We see that the mean $\boldsymbol\mu_k$ for the $k^{th}$ Gaussian component is obtained by taking a weighted mean of all of the points in the data set, in which the weighting factor for data point $\mathbf x_n$ is given by the posterior probability $\gamma(z_{nk})$ that component $k$ was responsible for generating $\mathbf x_n$.

If we set the derivative of $\ln(\mathbf X|\boldsymbol\pi,\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)$ with respect to $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$ to zero, and follow a similar line of reasoning, making use of the result for the maximum likelihood for the covariance matrix of a single Gaussian, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Sigma_k=\frac{1}{N_k}\sum^N_{n=1}\gamma(z_{nk})(\mathbf x_n-\boldsymbol\mu_k)(\mathbf x_n-\boldsymbol\mu_k)^{\mathrm T}
\end{equation}
which has the same form as the corresponding result for a single Gaussian fitted to the data set, but again with each data point weighted by the corresponding posterior
probability and with the denominator given by the effective number of points associated with the corresponding component.

Finally, we maximize $\ln p(\mathbf X|\boldsymbol\pi,\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)$ with respect to the mixing coefficients $\pi_k$. Here we must take account of the constraint $\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k=1$. This can be achieved using a Lagrange multiplier and maximizing the following quantity
\begin{equation}
\ln p(\mathbf X|\boldsymbol\pi,\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)+\lambda(\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k-1)
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
0=\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{\sum_j\pi_j\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_j,\boldsymbol\Sigma_j)}
\end{equation}
where again we see the appearance of the responsibilities. If we now multiply both sides by $\pi_k$ and sum over $k$ making use of the constraint $\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k=1$, we find $\lambda=-N$. Using this to eliminate $\lambda$ and rearranging we obtain
\begin{equation}
\pi_k=\frac{N_k}{N}
\end{equation}
so that the mixing coefficient for the $k^{th}$ component is given by the average responsibility which that component takes for explaining the data points.
\subsection{EM Algorithm}
Given a Gaussian mixture model, the goal is to maximize the likelihood function with respect to the parameters (comprising the means and covariances of the components and the mixing coefficients).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initialize the means $\boldsymbol\mu_k$, covariances $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k$ and mixing coefficients $\pi_k$, and evaluate the initial value of the log likelihood.
	\item \textbf{E step}. Evaluate the responsibilities using the current parameter values
	\begin{equation}
	\gamma(z_{nk})=\frac{\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^K\pi_j\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_j,\boldsymbol\Sigma_j)}
	\end{equation}
	\item \textbf{M step}. Re-estimate the parameters using the current responsibilities
	\begin{gather}
	\boldsymbol\mu_k^{new}=\frac{1}{N_k}\sum_{n=1}^N\gamma(z_{nk})\mathbf x_n\\
	\boldsymbol\Sigma_k^{new}=\frac{1}{N_k}\sum_{n=1}^N\gamma(z_{nk})(\mathbf x_n-\boldsymbol\mu_k^{new})(\mathbf x_n-\boldsymbol\mu_k^{new})^{\mathrm T}\\
	\pi_k^{new}=\frac{N_k}{N}
	\end{gather}
	where 
	\begin{equation}
	N_k=\sum_{n=1}^N\gamma(z_{nk}).
	\end{equation}
	\item Evaluate the log likelihood
	\begin{equation}
	\ln p(\mathbf X|\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma,\boldsymbol\pi)=\sum_{n=1}^N\ln \{\sum_{k=1}^K\pi_k\mathcal N(\mathbf x_n|\boldsymbol\mu_k,\boldsymbol\Sigma_k\}
	\end{equation}
	and check for convergence of either the parameters or the log likelihood. If the convergence criterion is not satisfied return to step 2.
	
\end{enumerate}

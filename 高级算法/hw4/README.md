Mid-term Assignments
================

### Bonuses
- We open-sourced our project in GitHub.

    [project](https://github.com/guzy0324/dqn-breakout)

- We composed our report in English.

    [report](./18340047-郭晓龙-18308045-谷正阳.pdf)

- We completed all three tasks mentioned in the slide.
  And we rendered two videos, one of which is the control group


  [video1](./Dueling_134.webm)

  , the other of which is the experimental group

  [video2](./Stable_134.webm)

  to show the stability of paddle in the third task intuitively.

  We can see that the experimental group doesn't shake until the very end.

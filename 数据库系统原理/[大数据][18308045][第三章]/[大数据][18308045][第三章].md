```sql
select distinct name
from student, takes, course
where student.ID = takes.ID and takes.course_id = course.course_id
and dept_name = "Comp. Sci."
```
b.
```sql
select ID, name
from student
except
select ID, name
from student, takes, section

```
c.
```sql
select max(salary), dept_name
from instructor
group by dept_name
```
d.
```sql
select min(max_salary)
from (select max(salary) as max_salary, dept_name

a.
```sql
insert into course
values("CS-001", "Weekly Seminar", "Comp. Sci.", 0)
```
b.
```sql
insert into section
values("CS-001", 1, "Autumn", 2009, null, null, null)
```
c.
```sql
insert into takes
select ID, "CS-001", 1, "Autumn", 2009, null

where dept_name = "Comp. Sci."
```
d.
```sql
delete from takes
where course_id = "CS-001" and sec_id = 1 semester = and "Autumn" and year = 2009
and ID in (select ID
            from student
            where name = "Chavez")
```
e.
```sql
delete from takes
where course_id = "CS-001"
delete from section
where course_id = "CS-001"
delete from course
where course_id = "CS-001"
```
会发生外码错误，因为课程段有参照课程的外码。
f.
```sql
delete from takes
where course_id in (select course_id 
                    from course
                    where lower(title) like "%database%")

`x <>all S`即一元素x与一子查询S中任意元素都满足不等，当且仅当x不在S中即`x not in S`。

`year` `corse_id` `semester` `year` `sec_id`是`takes`参照`sction`。所以每个`takes`可以匹配至多一个`section`，所以每个组不会有更多元组。另外，这些属性是`section`的主码，不能是`null`，因而自然连接后每个组不会丢失元组，所以结果相同。

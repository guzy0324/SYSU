that the eddie bauer carrier is only held in place by a strap   it does not lock into place  like all of the other carriers would   now  it may seem that why not use just the strap   well  the strap

time working mom i needed to get an electrical pump so that i could send milk to day care   i had planned on buying the medula because that is what anyone i know used   when i got to babies r us the sales lady talked me into the playtex   she said they had just had a demonstration at the store about the pump and if she was to buy a pump over again she would go with this one   she said she has a medula  but after the demonstration she really liked this one   so  on her advice and the basis that this would be cheaper for me because i had coupons i went for it   br    br  i find the pump to be very comfortable and i use full speed and suction   i do not get sore like i used to when i used my manual medula from the hospital    the storage is great and it is very easy to clean   br    br  after about a month of use i did have a problem where the pump would randomly shut off and eventually stopped working   i called playtex and they overnighted me a new pump nad sent me a tag to return the old one free of charge     i went less than   hours without it   they were great to deal with   br    br  i would recommend this pump to anyone\nterrible this monitor was terrible   even with the volume turned all the way up both on the child receiver and the parent receiver  i still couldn't hear my son   sometimes i would hear him crying from the other room but couldn't hear him on the monitor   useless   i liked the light show so we bought the fisherprice flutter bye crib attachment  which has a light show  and then traded this monitor in for the fisher price  mhz monitor which has crystal clear reception\na great time saveri just bought this   days ago and i absolutely love it   my son is   months and i have been boiling the bottles in a pot   what a time consuming tedious task thzat was   now i just love to make bottles again ha ha this is a great product takes   minutes to sterilize about   bottles   love it  also so reasonably priced compared to the steam electric steralizers\nwhat can't be done with the boppy this was the best thing i received for my shower   first of all  i used it immediately on myself after coming home from the hospital   i used it to sit on to take the pressure off of my stitched area   i could sit on the couch  in the bed and at the kitchen table without needing any medication thanks boppy   as for my son  i use it for him to sleep on while i'm doing housework   i prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side  which adjusts to the perfect size for him   he sleeps like a baby   next  i use it when i feed him   i breastfed and went to bottles later   it was is perfect for both     i use it to lay him it after he eats so i can talk to him and he can explore the world     i use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time     i use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only   and    i have several more  but those are the main points   i would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my boppy     also  i wash the slip cover many times  and it is standing strong   i have only had to wash the pillow a few times  but it still looks brand new   boppy gets my can't live without vote a    update it also helped with my son sitting up   i would place it around him so he wouldn't get hurt if he would fall over   it keeps going and going and going\nit's slow and noisyi have been breast feeding pumping for     months and was using a double  electric pump   i bought the isis because of the small size for traveling and because of the good reviews it got   br    br  my advice for someone looking to buy it for travel   don't do it   it takes   minutes to express from both sides because it's so slow   the silicone insert is extremely 'squeaky' and extremely annoying   i also felt like i was going to get carpal tunnel in my hands from the pumping action   br    br  i also had a very difficult time getting the suction quite right   i wanted to cry when i used it the first couple of times\nbest bottles i've foundwith my first child  we started with avent  which leaked   then we used dr  brown's  but it's just too much of a hassle to clean that tiny little tube   now  with our second child  we started out with playtex ventaire   they also leaked  even when everything was perfectly dried and put together   i just bought a set of the gerber premiums   my only complaint is that my daughter seems to dribble more with these bottles  but she may not be used to them just yet\nworth the moneyi definitely feel that this seat is worth the extra money over the other popular seats   it seems to have more cushioning and just feels more substantial   i do agree with some of the other reviewers that the seat is warm   my son  who is   months now  sweats terribly in it  which is a problem since we live in florida   he outgrew the head rest rather quickly  but he also had great head control and he hated the head rest   i think he felt too confined   the only other drawback about the seat is its weight   very heavy   a plus is that it fits my maclaren global stroller very nicely   all in all  a good  safe seat\npoor qualityafter the first washing  two of the five blankets fell apart  i registered and received both the blue and green receiving blankets and returned them both  i originally chose these because the patterns were so cute but the poor quality isn't worth keeping them  i wouldn't buy them\nshoulder strap too narrow  it hurtsi liked this sling because of the pockets  and it looks cool  but it hurts if you wear it for more than a few minutes   i also have a new native baby sling which is fabulous  and never hurts because the part that goes over your shoulder is wide   br    br  don't buy it  don't register for it   go new native\njunki recieved the monitor has a gift  i used it when i was at my parents house  because the babys room is on the other side of the house  i kept hearing other peoples conversations and i thought that was normal  then i started hearing ticking sounds  then one moring i woke up and it wasn't working  luckly the baby was looking at her mobile just laying there  then i would hear strange sounds coming from both ends  this is my first time using thos product and my baby is seven months old  i am very upset about this monitor\ngreat for bottles i love this rack i wish it were bigger since i wash what seems like a hundred bottles a day   i don't have a dishwasher ugh   i have a large towel on the counter and i usually use this rack for the nipples  and the compartment for the pacifiers\npoor craftsmanshipthe cushion padding for my ottoman came out of the box looking awful   the stitching isn't straight and is ripping apart before i've even used it   i'm hoping i'll be able to get a free replacement from the company       babies r us switched out the cushion for me   i just had to make an extra trip to the store\nlight and mobile light  inexpensive and easy to move around  if space is scarce  this is for you  the plastic is easy to clean\nvery leary of this now  i have been using this since we brought our baby home   for the first few weeks it was a useful item   we would swaddle her in a kiddopotomous  and put her in here and she would sleep very well   around a month  she started getting wrestless about being swaddled so we used a baby blanket   she started outgrowing this at about   weeks   we would find her with her head hanging off the top of the incline   i adusted the side supports so it was a little more snug  and farther down so that her head wouldn't slide off   within a couple of days i woke up to find her under the blanket with her head between the two side supports   this to me is more dangerous than allowing her to sleep on her tummy   we were leary of potential suffocation   our baby is currently   weeks old  i feel this was a waste of money considering it was only useful for a month   this product needed to be made about   inches longer  and the side supports needed to be made with a mesh fabric for breathability just in case the baby wiggles her way down   good idea  but needs improvement\nlife savorfirst i want to comment on the  st person's review   this pillow is not for a one month old  it's for   months and up   did not do her research br  br  this pillow is awesome   now my son's head doesn't slouch down to his chest while napping   and very soft\nexcellent because you don't have to buy any refills  thank goodness  and i have a baby trend travel system that is truely awesome  i thought i'd give it a go     br  i couldn't be happier no smells  easy to use and very economical for our tight budget  this pail stands up to it's name a true champ\nbetter than the bouncershaving three children i decided to go with the walker  we never used one before because it was never recommend by dr's  this center is the best  it has stoppers so don't fear your little one can't move  pull them out and you can push them from room to room with you with the handy holder in the back  the baby loves it and i think it's great  also  mom's who have taller babies this one lasts longer than the average bouncer seems it adjusts higher than the others\nthis is a great rocker we have had a chair like this for our daughter who will be   years old in may  she hated it as a baby  we had other bouncer seats for our two sons that they loved  i think the fact that if the kick stand is out the seat doesn't move she got real bored real fast  plus it lays so far back that she couldn't see all that was going on around her  but now that she is older and it can be used as a rocker she loves it  it gets used every day to either watch tv or read books or to just hang out in  plus she loves having her own chair\ngreat mattress when my son was born we used our pack n play as our bassinet  however  he would not sleep well in it  my husband and i thought he was just not a good sleeper  however  at   weeks old we moved him to the crib  he has been sleeping through the night ever since  he looks soooo comfortable in his crib at night  i am so thankful that we bought this mattress  it certainly has made my life easier\ndisappointedi've been disappointed with this monitor   i didn't think that there would be that big of a difference between monitors  but when my second baby was born  my girls are only   months apart  i needed a second monitor   i chose fisher price for my second one so that i could tell which monitor went to which girl   my first monitor was the first years   unfortunately  the fisher price model has much more static and white noise when turned on than does the first years monitor   br    br  i can hear my daughter on it but the amount of white noise static is quite annoying even when the volume is turned down really low\neven the rubber ducky loves it i had orignally registered for the   in   bath station   then i read the reviews of injurys cause by them   plus  my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well   br  then i read the reviews and switched to this tub   my son and i love it   the hammock makes it so easy to wash my   month old   his body is supported so i rest his head on my arm   i don't have to hold him up until i have to wash his back area   he has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub     br  it fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well     br  love it\ni use almost everything i love this kit   everything in this kit is a necessity and works well   my only complaint is the nail clippers   they are a bit big to use on a newborn   br  oh  and i wish i knew what hospital the lady went to that received all of these products i got diapers and a formula bag i had to sneak the t shirt and blanket for memories\nvery disappointed others seem to have had a much better experience with this item  and we can't understand why   when assembling the table  it quickly became clear that it was poorly made and the components were badly engineered   for example  one of the bars would not accept the screw that the manufacturer provided for it   the screw would not bite   the dowels were not well sanded and seemed as if they could cause splinters   we decided it wasn't worth continuing the assembly and returned it   also note  the shelves are made of a very thin composite wood and are flimsy   this thing is overpriced and unsafe\nturning this thing takes an act of god i bought this to use for my newborn and   year old  i took it to the mall yesterday and it was a nightmare  turns are impossible  i returned it last night and am giving the duoglider by graco a try  it's got much better ratings  don't waste your time on this one just because it may look better and has a cool toy  it's not worth it\nworked well in car crashi bought this product because i was so afraid of the seat belt not being tight enough for the infant seat base   i have used this product since my son was just a few months old   i loved it   i never worried about the seat belt again   i was in a car accident with my child when he was almost   years old   i was still using this product with his forward facing car seat   my car was totalled  i drove a saturn the only part of the car without damage was the roof   the drivers side my son's car seat was on the rear passenger side  so he recieved more of the impact than i did being the driver   i honestly believe that this  product saved him from worse injuries than he recieved   he came out of the wreck with only scratches on the top of his head   even though the mighty tite makes the seat belt tight so that the car seat itself won't slide around  his car seat still fell over   that is what shielded his body   face from the glass   i don't know how it worked out that way  but if his car seat hadn't fallen to its side  i think that he may have been hurt more   the mighty tite still worked fine after the wreck    the seat belt never broke like some of the other reviews say   my son is now in a booster seat   we don't use the mighty tite anymore  but i am pregnant with my  nd child  i am definately going to use this product again with this baby\nwatch baby's head with those corners i chose this tub because it folds up  however  since we use it every night  i haven't folded it up since week   i do like the tub but find it cumbersome to use  it does leak through one of the fold up hinge gaps if there's too much water in the tub  also  baby is now nearly   weeks old  and already  her feet spill over the end of the seat area  she's very nearly too big for it and measured   at her  wk checkup  i can't see her fitting in the tub much longer  her feet do get stuck in the gaps between the seat and the side of the tub  more importantly  for some reason  there are hard plastic corners along either side of the pad where her head is  she's knocked her head on them several times  and any other time  we spend the whole bath on guard  hoping she doesn't knock it  i'm also bothered when draining the tub  the plug has a little rim around it that sits up  i'm sure this helps prevent leaks  but it also prevents all water from adequately draining out  i have to turn the tub completely upside down to ensure that all water has drained  the more i think about it  the more i think i'd like to try a different tub  i'd recommend this tub only to those who are seriously crunched for space or who travel often and need a fold up tub\nexcellent bottle warmerwe registered for this gift after reading the reviews  one of the best selling points is the fact that the warmer automatically shuts off  i'd hate to leave it on  and have it catch fire or burn  it warms quickly  and you can easily adjust milk temperature by adding a little water  or using a little less  once you determine the best temp  for you  use that amount of water every time  and it beeps when it's ready  another great feature  very inexpensive also  we love it\nnot that impressedso far  i am not too impressed with this warmer   using the exact amount of water suggested with the level  i find that the avent  oz bottle of breast milk is still cold   however  scalding water drips off the bottle as i pull it out of the warmer  be careful not to burn yourself   i plan on trying different amounts of water to see if i can get the right ratio   but for something that is supposed to be a help  it is just creating more work for me thankfully  peanut doesn't mind his milk a little on the cold side\nnot for bottle linerswe have been using the bottle warmer and have found that it works best for regular botles  not ones with the bottle liners   the milk gets too hot with a four ounce bottle   it is fine for warming   ounce bottles   we've used plastic bootles as well as the little glass distilled water bottles and they seem to heat okay   i always stand right by the warmer and usually take it out before the timer goes off\ngood enough for methis isn't the greatest product ever invented  but it's cheap and it does its job  we have bottles of all shapes  amp  sizes and they all fit  it heats bottles very quickly  though i do recommend using a little less water than it says to avoid overheating\ni love it i love this bottle warmer   after researching different warmers i settles on this one   i use avent bottles but could not bring myself to spend   bucks on the avent warmer   i only paid   bucks  and it works great   i love the automatic shut off and it warms my bottles perfectly\nsave your moneyi finally broke down and opened this shower gift after my in laws kept complaining that i was serving the milk to cold   either the bottle is still too cold  or i have had several bottles where it has heated them so that the milk burned my hand   i am glad i did not believe the product information about no hot spots and tested the bottles first   i only wish i had saved the packaging and got my money back   save your money  a cup of hot water works fine and my daughter does not mind if it is slightly cold\nalways makes bottles too hotwe bought this bottle warmer two weeks ago because our little one recently switched to formula and we thought maybe we would keep this in his room to make night time feedings easier   we've tried it several different times during the day and every time the bottle come out scalding hot and we have to soak them in cold water to make them drinkable for our little boy   i guess we'll just go back to heating his bottles in hot water in the sink   way more trouble than it's worth\n"}],"source":"count('0')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# -*- coding:utf-8 -*\n","import openpyxl\n","import nltk\n","from textblob.classifiers
